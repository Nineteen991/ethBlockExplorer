In teaching myself more about blockchain development, I decided 
to create an ethereum blockchain explorer. 

I saw an Alchemy tutorial about creating a basic explorer, but
I didn't like how it was setup. It was just a frontend project
with the .env file to be used by react.

I wanted to make this a larger more secure app so I added a 
node backend that would take in requests from the frontend.
I also decided to try out vite instead of my usual create-react-app.
Let's see how this goes.
